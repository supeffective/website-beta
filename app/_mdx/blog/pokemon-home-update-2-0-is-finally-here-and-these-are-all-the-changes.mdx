The long-awaited HOME update, which brings support for the latest games, is finally coming to our Switch and Mobile
phones.

The HOME servers will undergo maintenance for 6h, from tomorrow May 18th 00:00 UTC until 06:00 UTC.

Users will be able to log in again in stages after that period until May 19th 2022 01:00 UTC, to avoid overloading the
servers.

According to the official Twitter account, the new version (2.0) is scheduled to be released during that period.

This means that Pokémon Brilliant Diamond, Shining Pearl, and Legends Arceus will be compatible with HOME and you will
be able to transfer your Pokémon back and forth.

Legends Arceus caught Pokémon Pokéball will be replaced with a "Strange Ball" when transferred to other games as well as
Pokémon from other games being transferred to Legends Arceus. Moves and Effort Levels will be also replaced.

To know more about how it works, visit the [official HOME page](https://home.pokemon.com/en-us/move/).

Trainers, we recommend you to be a bit careful with this first release, especially when it comes to Brilliant Diamond
and Shining Pearl, because of the potential glitches.

SuperEffective.gg **Living Dex tracker will be updated soon** to support the new Pokémon and also with the ability to
track and save which ones you have. We are working hard on this new release, at the same time that we are also waiting
for the new assets to be available
