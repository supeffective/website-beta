Dear Pokemon trainers around the world,

1st of March of 2022 marks a new beginning for me in the world of PokÃ©mon, which I love since 1998 when I started
playing Red/Blue & Gold/Silver.

I never stopped playing PokÃ©mon games ever since I felt what I felt when playing Gold and Silver and every PokÃ©mon I saw
was new to me. I remember breeding Jynx and Mr. Mime (without knowing what I was doing) and discovering Smoochum for the
first time!

The truth is that I didn't have other games back then more than Megadrive's Sonic The Hedgehog, and the typical Mario
games for Game Boy, so after discovering PokÃ©mon it quickly became my new favorite game series. After that, I started
loving Nintendo games more and more. I am a big The Legend of Zelda fan as well.

### Background

Gaming is an important aspect of my life and one of my dreams has always been becoming a game developer. I've always
tried to learn it on my own using Adobe Flash, but didn't succeed. Back in the 2005s when I finished my High School and
had to decide which career to take, there was no much opportunities for me to learn game development in Mallorca (there
was basically no academic courses or private schools for that), so I started learning software development.

Right now I am a Tech Lead and Senior Software Engineer with more than 12 years of experience, half of them living
abroad in Germany. I can say I am a full-stack web developer (frontend and backend services, aka. UI and server), but I
have developed more the backend part in the last years. With this project, _SuperEffective.gg_ (which I will name
SuperEffective from now on) I want to bring two of the things I enjoy the most together: PokÃ©mon games and software
development.

### Why in english?

Now you might be wondering why is this blog and this site in english and not spanish, if I am a spanish native? Well, I
had this dilemma for a couple of days before writing this first post, and the reasons are simple: the projects I've been
working on until know have been in english and oriented to english speakers. It will be also a lot of effort to maintain
a bilingual site and If I do it only in spanish I will be missing a big part of the people that already follow me on my
twitter accounts. If I mix languages I will make search engines unhappy and people would be confused as well.

So I'd stay with english for now, so sorry for the native english speakers of I do mistakes (which for sure I will do
very often).

### The early stages

Going back to the development part, for a long time I've been trying to have a site with a PokÃ©dex, news and other
tools, but I never had the time required to build it. I also remember having talks with Paul and @moving from PokeJungle
to develop a PokÃ©dex for their site some years ago, but I found out that it is a tremendous task that needs a lot of
investigation, data population, normalization, fixing, etc.

I will publish an article soon on how has been the road until now and the technical challenges I've faced.

### It's SuperEffective!

Now, after some years with lots of accumulated beta projects and other successful ones like
[Living Dex](https://itsjavi.com/livingdex/), I feel I've found a break-trough to bring all of them to the next level
and joining them under the same project: SuperEffective.

> **SuperEffective** comes after one of the most iconic phrases of PokÃ©mon: "It's super effective!". The logo represents
> a PokÃ©mon battle.
>
> The `.gg` part in the web domain means "good game" and it's becoming a recurring extension for fan websites related to
> gaming.

### Contents of the site

Some of the sections that I plan to have for SuperEffective are:

- **PokÃ©mon News**: latest relevant news of main and GO series games, rumors, investigation articles, strategies, etc.
- **DevLog**: There will be a section in the site that will be more technical, where I will be talking about the latest
  changes in the site, releases, web and game development, etc.
- The **Living Dex** HOME organizer, which I already mentioned earlier. It will be re-converted into a PokÃ©dex
  **tracker** and you will be able to mark PokÃ©mon as caught or not, if they are shiny etc. for every game individually,
  not only for HOME.
- **PokÃ©dex**: It was also part of the Living Dex project, but now I am working on bringing multiple PokÃ©dexes like in
  the real games, for example, to check the PokÃ©mon that appear in Legends Arceus, the Crown of Tundra PokÃ©dex, etc.
- **Tier List Maker**: I always wanted to have an easier tool to generate lists of Pokemon, because every time I go to
  tiermaker.com It's not easy to find what I want, it is slow, and it is not Pokemon-specific with a dedicated look and
  feel, so I decided to create my own. I already have a prototype already working and I only need to glue the pieces
  with SuperEffective in order to integrate it.
- **Showdown Team Parser and Generator** ([KoffingJS](https://cdn.supeffective.com/koffing/)): I developed this project
  some years ago and I'd love to integrate it in SuperEffective, so you have an alternate UI to generate your PokÃ©mon
  teams for [Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) and share them with others like pokepast.es.
- **Trainer Card Creator**: This is just an idea for now, but after finishing the previous ones this will be my next
  thing. I can only tell you that the possibilities are almost endless :).

> There will be a main section for all utilities called "PokÃ©Gear" to honor the device introduced in Gold and Silver,
> which was created by Siplh Co.

I'd also love to build a community that share the same love for these games. Let's see, I am curious to see all your
reactions and feedback about this project.

I am giving all my love to this project and I hope that you enjoy it using it the same way I enjoy creating it.
