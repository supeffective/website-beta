1.  This site provides free apps, services, and tools that will still be free as long as the server maintenance costs
    are low. Because of that, it is important a fair usage (to not abuse) of the services provided on this website.
2.  To be able to keep you providing a free service, we need to have some limitations in the way to use them:

    1.  _Living Dex Tracker_: During an indeterminate period of time, the number of dexes you can create is limited to 1
        per dual set of games (e.g. 1 per Sword or Shield).

3.  The site admins reserve the right to delete any user account or data, whenever there is a suspicion of the services
    being abused intentionally (via scripts, third-party tools, exploits of existing bugs, etc.)
4.  Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be
    tolerated in any part of our website (which includes comments and user-generated content). If you see something
    against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let us know. We want this community to be a welcoming
    space!
5.  No spam or self-promotion in any of our comments sections.
6.  No age-restricted or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or
    other graphically disturbing content.
7.  Piracy will not be tolerated. Do not share warez or discuss your devious plans for piracy. This includes topics like
    emulators, console piracy software, game ROMs, or manually-fabricated PokÃ©mon (via save editing apps or trade
    servers). If you are requesting help with pirated software, your comment will be deleted.
8.  The service is provided as-is. We don't take any responsibility in case of data loss due to a client or server
    malfunction, but we will always try to recover everything in case of disaster. Try to periodically backup your data
    whenever possible.
9.  Any activity, recurrent in time or not (depending on the severity), that is considered unfair or harmful to this
    website, to its community, or to other people, will be most probably translated into the termination of your account
    and/or deletion of your data, without any previous warning if the moderators consider so.

> _Let's make this community a nice, optimal, and welcoming one._
