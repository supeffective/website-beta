Following the release dates of previous games like Sword & Shield (November 15, 2019), and Brilliant Diamond & Shining
Pearl (November 19, 2021), the new Pokémon games Scarlet and Violet could be scheduled for a worldwide release on a
similar date.

The possible candidate is November 18, 2022, the third Friday of November, following the same pattern as the previous
main title releases.

This means that we will have to wait a bit longer, as expected, but we expect to have more news in the upcoming few
months.
