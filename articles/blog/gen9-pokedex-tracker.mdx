Hey there trainers! I am happy to announce that Scarlet and Violet is now supported in our website dex tracker.

Celebrating the release of Scarlet and Violet in our website, we also redesigned our logo. It's an emblem, symbolising
the super-effective type triad of every set of starter Pok√©mon.

Have fun and happy hunting! ¬†üéâ

**_In our Roadmap for next months:_**

- Ability to specify the Tera Type of your Pok√©mon
- Titan mark (similar to Alpha mark)
- Use the new Type icons (from BDSP, LA and SV)
- Site redesign (with better mobile experience)
- Email-based login (replacing Github, Google and Twitter logins)
- More freedom to add/remove certain categories of Pok√©mon (cosmetic forms, female forms, etc)
- Translations for Pok√©mon names (only ENG, ESP, ITA, DEU, FRA initially and then JAP, CHT/S, KOR)

**_Known issues of Scarlet/Violet support:_**

- Some Scarlet/Violet shiny Pok√©mon have missing sprites (this will be like this until they're available in other data
  sources like Serebii, Bulbapedia, Smogon or Showdown).
- Gen 9 Pok√©mon are not trackable in HOME living Pok√©dex. The site will support it once the official Pok√©mon HOME apps
  support S/V in 2023. We want to make things easy and not confuse people of what can be done or not currently.
