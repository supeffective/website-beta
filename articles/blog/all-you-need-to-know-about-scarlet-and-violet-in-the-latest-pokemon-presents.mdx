The new mechanic is called the Terastal Phenomenon. It will change the appearance of your Pokémon, a Terastal Jewel will
appear above them, depending on the type you power-up. Some Pokémon will also change their type.

You will need a Tera Orb to terastallize your Pokémon. Once used, you will need to recharge it with crystals or in a
Pokémon Center. You can use it only once per battle.

Multiplayer raids will be back in these games. They will be called Tera Raid Battles. You will access them activating
the shining crystals found in the overworld.
